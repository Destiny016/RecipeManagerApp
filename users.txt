RECIPE:Apple Pie|Dessert|INSTRUCTIONS\nStart by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 2 \n(9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the \npie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before\n rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow\n package directions.\nPlace oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C).\nIn a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, \nlight brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice\n and lemon zest; toss to coat evenly.\nRemove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest \nat room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured\n surface, roll one disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. \nCarefully lay the crust into the bottom of a deep dish pie\n plate.\nSpoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard\n juices at the bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc \nof pie crust until it is ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple\n filling.\nUse a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside\n edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie\n crust meet, gently press to seal and fold them under.\n Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges \nare neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top\n of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a\n baking sheet.\n|https://littlespoonfarm.com/apple-pie-recipe/#recipe|pie crust:1:9",sugar:1/2:cup,light brown sugar:1/2:cup,flour:2:Tbs,cinnamon:1:tps,nutmeg:1/8:tsp,egg:1:Large,sanding sugar:2:Tbs,
